/*Given two integers ‘a’ and ‘m’, find modular multiplicative inverse of ‘a’ under modulo ‘m’.
The modular multiplicative inverse is an integer ‘x’ such that.

a x ≅ 1 (mod m)
The value of x should be in { 1, 2, … m-1}, i.e., in the range of integer modulo m. ( Note that x cannot be 0 as a*0 mod m will never be 1 )
The multiplicative inverse of “a modulo m” exists if and only if a and m are relatively prime (i.e., if gcd(a, m) = 1).*/
